# 🚀 START HERE - Your Complete Learning Journey

## 💝 A Gift From Your Father

**Dear Mauricio,**

This course is a special gift created just for you by your father, **Sergio Muñoz de Alba Medrano**.

Watching you excel at **PE Club** in Brussels fills me with immense pride. Your work in Private Equity demands the best tools and skills, and this course will give you a competitive edge that few analysts have.

I've built this comprehensive program to help you master:
- **Modern development tools** (VS Code, Git, GitHub)
- **AI-powered coding** (GitHub Copilot)
- **Professional Python** for financial modeling
- **Advanced valuation techniques** for PE/IB work

You're already doing amazing work at PE Club. Now, let's take your technical skills to the next level.

With all my love and pride,

*Papá*

## Welcome to Advanced Financial Modeling with VS Code!

This course teaches you **three valuable skills at once**:
1. **VS Code mastery** - Modern development environment
2. **Python for finance** - Programming for financial analysis  
3. **AI-powered workflow** - GitHub Copilot & version control

**Built specifically for:** PE professionals who want to automate models and work 10x faster

---

## 📋 What You'll Learn

### VS Code Skills
- Navigate the interface like a pro
- Use keyboard shortcuts for speed
- Debug and run code efficiently
- Work with multiple files and terminals
- Customize your workspace

### GitHub & Copilot
- Version control your models (never lose work!)
- AI code assistant for faster development
- Collaborate and share models
- Build a professional portfolio

### 💎 IMPORTANT: Copilot & GitHub Subscriptions

**To get the FULL power of this course, you'll need:**

**1. GitHub Copilot Subscription ($10/month)**
- **Essential** for AI-assisted coding throughout this course
- Without it, you'll miss 70% of the productivity gains
- **Worth every penny** - writes code 10x faster
- Sign up: https://github.com/features/copilot
- **Your father's recommendation:** This is a career investment, not an expense

**2. GitHub Pro (Optional, $4/month)**
- Unlimited private repositories
- Advanced collaboration features
- Professional portfolio with insights
- **Good for PE work** - keep proprietary models private

**Total Investment:** ~$10-14/month for tools that will save you 10+ hours/week

**💡 Think of it this way:** If Copilot saves you even 2 hours per week, and your time is worth €50/hour (conservative for PE), that's €400/month in value for a €10 investment. **40x ROI!**

**Free Alternatives:**
- GitHub (free tier) - Works fine, but limited private repos
- No Copilot alternative - You really need this one

**Setup Order:**
1. ✅ Create free GitHub account first
2. ✅ Start 30-day Copilot free trial
3. ✅ Complete Module 1-2 during trial
4. ✅ Subscribe to Copilot (you'll be convinced by then!)
5. ✅ Upgrade to GitHub Pro if working with sensitive PE models

### Financial Modeling
- DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) models
- LBO (Leveraged Buyout) analysis
- M&A (Mergers & Acquisitions) modeling
- Private Equity fund analysis
- Real-world projects
