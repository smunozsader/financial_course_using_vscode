# Project 1: Complete LBO Model with Monte Carlo 🏢

## Business Context

PE Club is evaluating a **€500M leveraged buyout** of a European software company. Traditional LBO models show a 22% IRR, but the Investment Committee wants to understand the **probability distribution** of outcomes and **downside risk**.

You need to build a complete LBO model that:
- Calculates traditional returns (MOIC, IRR)
- Runs 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations
- Quantifies risk (VaR, probability of loss)
- Generates a professional PDF report

## Model Components

- Senior Debt        €300M        - Purchase Price      €500M
- Mezzanine Debt     €50M         - Transaction Fees    €25M
- Equity             €175M        - Refinancing         €25M
Total Sources:       €525M        Total Uses:           €525M
```

### 2. **Operating Assumptions**
- Entry EBITDA: €50M
- Entry Multiple: 10.0x
- Revenue Growth: 8% ± 3% (Monte Carlo variable)
- EBITDA Margin: 30% ± 5% (Monte Carlo variable)
- CapEx: 5% of revenue
- Working Capital: 10% of revenue change

### 3. **Debt Structure**
- Senior Debt: €300M at 5.0%, amortizes 10% annually
- Mezzanine: €50M at 9.0%, PIK for 3 years, then cash
- Debt/EBITDA covenant: Must stay below 5.0x

### 4. **Exit Assumptions**
- Holding Period: 5 years
- Exit Multiple: 11.0x ± 2.0x (Monte Carlo variable)
- Exit via strategic sale

### 5. **Monte Carlo Variables**
- Revenue Growth Rate (normal distribution)
- EBITDA Margin (normal distribution)
- Exit Multiple (normal distribution)
- Debt Paydown Rate (varies with FCF generation)

# Project 2: API-Powered DCF Valuation Tool 📊

## Business Context

PE Club is considering investing in **Microsoft (MSFT)**. Instead of manually entering financial data from Bloomberg, you'll build an automated DCF that:
- Pulls latest financials from Yahoo Finance
- Projects cash flows with customizable assumptions
- Calculates intrinsic value
- Generates valuation ranges
- Exports professional Excel model

## Model Components

### 1. **Data Acquisition (Automated)**
```python
import yfinance as yf

# Automatically download:
- Income statement (3 years historical)
- Balance sheet (3 years historical)
- Cash flow statement (3 years historical)
- Current stock price
- Shares outstanding
- Market cap
```

### 2. **Financial Analysis**
```
Historical Analysis:
- Revenue CAGR (3-year)
- EBITDA margin trend
- CapEx as % of revenue
- Working capital changes
- FCF conversion rate
```

### 3. **Projections (5 years)**
```
User-Defined Assumptions:
- Revenue growth rate (with fade)
- EBITDA margin expansion
- Tax rate
- CapEx ratio
- NWC investment

Calculated Automatically:
- EBITDA = Revenue × Margin
- D&A (from historical %)
- EBIT = EBITDA - D&A
- Tax = EBIT × Tax Rate
- NOPAT = EBIT - Tax
- CapEx = Revenue × CapEx %
- Δ NWC = Revenue Growth × NWC %
- FCF = NOPAT + D&A - CapEx - Δ NWC
```

### 4. **Terminal Value**
```
Two Methods:
1. Perpetuity Growth: TV = FCF_year5 × (1+g) / (WACC - g)
2. Exit Multiple: TV = EBITDA_year5 × Exit_Multiple
```

### 5. **WACC Calculation**
```
WACC = (E/V × Cost of Equity) + (D/V × Cost of Debt × (1-Tax))

Where:
- Cost of Equity: CAPM = Rf + β(Rm - Rf)
- Cost of Debt: From financial data
- E/V, D/V: From balance sheet
```

### 6. **Valuation**
```
Enterprise Value = PV(FCFs) + PV(Terminal Value)
Equity Value = EV - Net Debt
Value per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

Upside/(Downside) = (Intrinsic Value - Current Price) / Current Price
```

## Expected Outputs

### **Console Output:**

# Project 4: PE Fund Portfolio Dashboard 💼

## Business Context

You're managing a PE fund with **8 portfolio companies** across different sectors and vintages. Limited Partners (LPs) want quarterly reporting on:
- Individual company performance
- Portfolio-level returns (IRR, MOIC, DPI, TVPI)
- Waterfall distribution (LP/GP split, carry calculation)
- Mark-to-market valuations
- Performance attribution

You need a dashboard that aggregates all data and generates LP-ready reports.

## Model Components
